The Interrogation Room Service (IRS) interfaces with the Encryption Key Store Service to process Crypt4GH encrypted files uploaded to the inbox of a local GHGA node.
The IRS splits off the file envelope, computes part checksums over the encrypted file content, validates the checksum over the unencrypted file content (in memory) and initiates transfer of the encrypted file content to its permanent storage.
